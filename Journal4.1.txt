Mary Flannery O'Connor's faith? was an anomaly for the early 20th century South. Catholic O'Connor was something of a stranger among the tightly knit communities of Protestants that lived up and down her residency in the American Bible Belt. But it is perhaps this semi-outsider perspective (--O'Connor wasn't a complete outsider or "other", still being white and Christian after all) that simultaneously gave O'Connor an intimate understanding of South Protestantism while shielding her from group-think-- allowing her to craft her own critiques of this particular brand of faith into grotesque, religiously-charged fictional tragedies that resolve through the Grace of God alone. However it would be a mistake to think that O'Connor held hostile views of her brother Protestants; rather, O'Connor stories use criticism derived from quirks in Protestant belief and character to magnify the affect of Christian themes she presents later at the end of her stories. Thus, O'Connor's stories end up resonating with Protestants as much as Catholics. So through this unique examination of her Protestant brothers and sisters, along with her ability to incorporate themes such as grace within masterful thematic structure, O'Connor is renowned as one of the greatest Christian writers and among the best American writers of all time. Her short story "The River" is a brilliantly written example of a classic O'Connor tragedy, as its slow-building thematic structure combines a critique of fundamentalist Protestantism with the theme of salvation through the grace of God.
